# Building a Game Engine with Rust from the Ground Up

This repository serves as the starting point for building a simple yet functional game engine using Rust. The project is designed to help you apply the concepts and skills you've learned throughout the Rust course. By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with Rust's advanced features, including multi-threading, macros, and interoperability with C code.

## Getting Started

When working on this project, you can choose between utilizing Udacity's workspace environment or setting it all up on your local machine. If you prefer to use the workspace, you can skip the prerequisite steps and jump straight to the project instructions. Otherwise, follow the steps below to set up your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

While this project has no specific dependencies on any system, it was built on a Unix-based machine. So, if you're on Windows, I'd recommend using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), so all instructions here directly apply to your system.  

To start with your project, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/intro-to-rust-starter.git
# or, git clone git@github.com:udacity/intro-to-rust-starter.git
```
